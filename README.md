# Arduino_Projects

*Hello and welcome!*

This page is entirely dedicated to my projects which i work on in school with my Arduino. Generally i upload it here so i can save it online, but i also upload it so it's free to use for everyone and learning purposes.

This is just the beginning and eventually this repository will grow, so stay tuned.

You can aswell check my other repositories/projects.
